A lightweight [Serde]-compatible [TOML][toml-lang] parser written in Rust

## *but why?*

The [toml][toml-rs] crate has lots of amazing features, but that makes it really heavy in terms of binary size and compile times.
For one of my other projects toml accounted for over 15% of the compiled binary size despite only being used to read one small config file.

This project designed to sit at the opposite end of the spectrum, offering basic TOML support for [Serde] with a much smaller footprint.
See the comparison table below for a more detailed comparison of TOML crates.

We also aim to maintain API-compatibility with the toml crate, so migrating to (or from) soml should be relatively easy.

## Features

Feature    | Default | Description
:----------|:-------:|:----------------------------------------------
`std`      |    ✅    | Enables `std` support
`strict`   |    ✅    | Enables extra checks for strict compliance with the TOML spec (see below)
`datetime` |    ✅    | Enables support for TOML date-time values

### The `strict` feature

The (enabled by default) `strict` feature adds certain checks required to validate compliance with the TOML spec.
These checks can be disabled allowing the parser accept some unambiguous but not-technically-valid TOML.
For some applications disabling the `strict` feature could yield a small performance improvement.

The following checks are currently disabled without the `strict` feature:

- Validate comments are valid UTF-8
- Scan comments for disallowed control characters
- Range checking on date-time values
  - For example, `2024-14-35T25:61:63` is invalid

**ℹ️ Important** \
The exact list of checks controlled by the `strict` feature is considered an implementation detail and is subject to change.
Changes to which not-strictly-valid TOML is accepted when `strict` is disabled is not considered a breaking change.

| [soml]<br>(`datetime` disabled) |  0.1.0  |   97 KiB   |     ✅      |    1.0 †     |
