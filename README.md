A lightweight [Serde]-compatible [TOML][toml-lang] parser written in Rust

## *but why?*

The [toml][toml-rs] crate has lots of amazing features, but that makes it really heavy in terms of binary size and compile times.
For one of my other projects toml accounted for over 15% of the compiled binary size despite only being used to read one small config file.

This project designed to sit at the opposite end of the spectrum, offering basic TOML support for [Serde] with a much smaller footprint.
See the comparison table below for a more detailed comparison of TOML crates.

We also aim to maintain API-compatibility with the toml crate, so migrating to (or from) soml should be relatively easy.

## Features

Feature    | Default | Description
:----------|:-------:|:----------------------------------------------
`std`      |    ✅    | Enables `std` support
`alloc`    |         | Enables `alloc` support for `no_std` targets
`datetime` |    ✅    | Enables support for TOML date-time values
`fast`     |         | Disables certain checks required by the TOML spec to improve performance (see below)

### The `fast` feature

The `fast` feature disables certain checks required by the TOML spec to improve overall performance.
This will produce the same result for any valid TOML document, but the parser will be slightly more permissive of not-technically-valid input.
The `fast` feature should not be enabled if strict compliance with the TOML spec is required.

The following checks are currently disabled:

- Doesn't check comments for valid UTF-8
- Doesn't check comments for disallowed control characters
- Skips validating date-time values
  - For example, `2024-14-35T25:61:63` will not be rejected as invalid

## Comparison of TOML crates

This table is autogenerated by [`scripts/size-test.py`]:

Crate | Version | Size &ast; | Maintained | TOML version
:----:|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:
[soml] | 0.1.0 | 438 kB | ✅ | 1.0
[toml] | 0.8.20 | 569 kB | ✅ | 1.0
[toml] | 0.5.11 | 399 kB | ❌ | 0.5
[basic-toml] | 0.1.10 | 397 kB | ❌ | 0.5 (partial †)

&ast; *Refers to the size of the `.text` section of a simple round-trip parse-then-write binary.
This is calculated using [`cargo-bloat`] with the release profile.* \
† *Does not support TOML date-time types.*
